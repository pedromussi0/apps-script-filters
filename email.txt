Subject: How to Use Our New Product Filters in Google Sheets
Hi Non Tech Person,
This is our new Product Filter tool for our Google Sheets document, and here's how to use it:
Using the Product Filters (Step-by-Step):

- Open our Google Sheets document
- Look for the "Product Filters" menu at the top (next to "Help")
- Click on "Product Filters" and select "Show Filter Dialog"
- A small window will pop up with filtering options:

To filter by price: Enter minimum and/or maximum price values
To filter by color: Select a color from the dropdown menu
To filter by size: Choose a size from the options
To filter by gender: Select the gender category you need


Click the blue "Apply Filters" button
Two new sheets will automatically be created:

A sheet with your filtered products
A summary sheet showing what filters you applied



The original data remains unchanged, so feel free to experiment with different filters!
To Go Back to the Original Data
If you want to return to the complete product list:

Click "Product Filters" in the menu
Select "Reset All Filters"
Click "Yes" when prompted

Please let me know if you have any questions or run into any issues! This tool should save us lots of time when looking for specific product information.
Best regards,
Pedro
